# Web3.0 Application
This repository contains a web application that allows users to send ethereum from one wallet to another.  
The smart contract is deployed to the Ropsten Test Network and therefore requires a Metamaska account connected to the Ropsten network.

-----------------------------------------------------

To test the application, go through the following steps:

-----------------------------------------------------
Clone the repo and run npm install on both folders  
Cd into client folder and run the command "npm run dev" in terminal  
Install Metamask, connect it to Ropsten Test Network and aquire free test ethereum from a ropsten faucet  
Create a secondary account within your Metamask wallet, and send ethereum from your first account to your second account

Main motivation for this project was to get a hands-on experience with Solidity and smart contracts.

The overall experience was fun, and Solidity felt very familiar in terms of syntax and functions.  
Acquired a better understanding of how smart contracts work.  
A lot of good tools that automate processes, such as deploying a smart contract to the blockchain. Pros of this is that it makes things a lot easier, the cons is that I don't fully understand the automated processes.  
Solidity was easy to work with and felt familiar in terms of syntax and functions.  
Learned that a good part of blockchain-development consists of front-end development, as the smart-contracts still need a UI to connect with the user.</br > </br >

Really happy with how the front-end turned out, but took too much time considering it was not the main focus of the project.  
Moving forward i will focus on building more advanced smart-contracts without too much focus on front-end development.
